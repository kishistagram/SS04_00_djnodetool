# Domain Model

## Overview

The core domain is a graph-based music arrangement.

The main entities are:

- Track
- TrackNode
- TransitionEdge
- Project

The distinction between Track and TrackNode is important.

A Track is music data.

A TrackNode is the visual placement of that track on the canvas.

A TransitionEdge defines how playback or meaning moves from one node to another.

## Track

A Track represents an audio item.

It contains metadata about the music itself.

```ts
export type Track = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist?: string;
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  durationSec?: number;
  audioUrl?: string;
  tags: string[];
};
```

### Notes

- `id` must be stable and unique.
- `title` is required.
- `artist` is optional because generated or local files may not have artist metadata.
- `bpm` is optional because automatic BPM detection is not part of the MVP.
- `key` is optional.
- `durationSec` is optional.
- `audioUrl` may point to a local object URL, sample file, or mock source.
- `tags` can represent genre, mood, memory, or user-defined categories.

## TrackNode

A TrackNode represents a track placed on the canvas.

```ts
export type TrackNode = {
  id: string;
  trackId: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  label: string;
  color?: string;
};
```

### Notes

- `id` identifies the node, not the track.
- `trackId` links the node to a Track.
- `x` and `y` are CSS pixel coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the canvas.
- `label` is what the user sees on the node. In the MVP, it is initialized from `Track.title`. Node renaming is not implemented in the MVP.
- `color` is assigned automatically in the MVP. User-defined color editing is not implemented in the MVP.

## TransitionEdge

A TransitionEdge connects two TrackNodes.

It represents a transition or relationship from one node to another.

```ts
export type TransitionType = "cut" | "fade" | "crossfade";

export type TransitionEdge = {
  id: string;
  fromNodeId: string;
  toNodeId: string;
  transitionType: TransitionType;
  fadeDurationSec: number;
  note?: string;
};
```

### Notes

- `fromNodeId` is the starting node.
- `toNodeId` is the destination node.
- `transitionType` defines how the transition should behave.
- `fadeDurationSec` is required. For `cut`, use `0` by convention. For `fade` and `crossfade`, use a positive number.
- `note` can describe why the user connected the tracks.

Examples of notes:

- "same summer feeling"
- "tempo contrast"
- "late night transition"
- "nostalgic mood"
- "good after chorus"

## Project

A Project contains the full music graph.

```ts
export type Project = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  tracks: Track[];
  nodes: TrackNode[];
  edges: TransitionEdge[];
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
};
```

### Notes

- The project should be serializable as JSON.
- The project should not depend on React-specific state.
- The project data should be clean enough to export, import, and inspect manually.

## Graph Meaning

The app should treat the arrangement as a directed graph.

```txt
TrackNode A --> TransitionEdge --> TrackNode B
```

For the MVP, edges can be directional.

This means an edge from A to B does not automatically mean there is an edge from B to A.

## Example Project

```ts
export const mockProject: Project = {
  id: "project-001",
  title: "Late Night Prototype Mix",
  tracks: [
    {
      id: "track-001",
      title: "Night Drive",
      artist: "Sample Artist",
      bpm: 110,
      durationSec: 180,
      audioUrl: "/audio/night-drive.mp3",
      tags: ["night", "drive", "smooth"]
    },
    {
      id: "track-002",
      title: "Blue Memory",
      artist: "Sample Artist",
      bpm: 112,
      durationSec: 200,
      audioUrl: "/audio/blue-memory.mp3",
      tags: ["nostalgia", "blue", "soft"]
    }
  ],
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "node-001",
      trackId: "track-001",
      x: 100,
      y: 160,
      label: "Night Drive",
      color: "#3B82F6"
    },
    {
      id: "node-002",
      trackId: "track-002",
      x: 360,
      y: 220,
      label: "Blue Memory",
      color: "#6366F1"
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    {
      id: "edge-001",
      fromNodeId: "node-001",
      toNodeId: "node-002",
      transitionType: "crossfade",
      fadeDurationSec: 5,
      note: "smooth late-night transition"
    }
  ]
};
```

## ID Generation

IDs in mock data use human-readable strings such as `"track-001"`.

IDs created at runtime use `crypto.randomUUID()`.

## Design Rules

- Keep domain types independent from UI libraries.
- Do not mix React component state into the domain model.
- Do not store computed UI-only values in the project unless necessary.
- Do not add backend-specific fields in the MVP.
- Keep the model easy to inspect as JSON.

## Future Extensions

Possible future fields:

```ts
mood?: string[];
energy?: number;
waveformUrl?: string;
analysis?: {
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  loudness?: number;
};
aiPrompt?: string;
imagePrompt?: string;
```

These should not be added until the MVP is stable.
